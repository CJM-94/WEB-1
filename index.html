      The World Wide Web has become a major delivery platform for a variety of
      complex and sophisticated enterprise applications in several domains. In
      addition to their inherent multifaceted functionality, these Web
      applications exhibit complex behaviour and place some unique demands on
      their usability, performance, security, and ability to grow and evolve.
      However, a vast majority of these applications continue to be developed in
      an ad hoc way, contributing to problems of usability, maintainability,
      quality and reliability. While Web development can benefit from
      established practices from other related disciplines, it has certain
      distinguishing characteristics that demand special considerations. In
      recent years, there have been developments towards addressing these
      considerations.
